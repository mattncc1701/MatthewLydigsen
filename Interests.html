               <img src="images/trumpetpicmicca.JPG" class="img-responsive" width = "250" align="left"

               <p style="line-height: 1.8;"> I have been playing the trumpet for over a decade and have been involved in many musical groups. I went to Clinton High
               School and was part of the Clinton High School band for four years. During that time I also took trumpet lessons
               with Mark Bacon in order to expand my musical education. My senior year of high school I earned a chair in the
               Central Districts Music Festival. It took me all four years of my high school career to be selected for that
               festival and although I made it by the skin of my teeth in last chair I was still proud to have made it at all.</p>
               <br>
               <p style="line-height: 1.8;">In college I joined the University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band (UMMB). It is a lot of work. We
               have practice monday-friday from 440-610 during the fall semester and most of our weekends are gone. We start when
               the temperature is at its highest and end the year when the temperature is at its lowest. But I still love
               the band and I have had some amazing perormances which include performing at Gillette Stadium, Penn State, Allentown,
               and my freshman year the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. Aside from the band I am also part of the Hoop Band
               at Umass. We are a pep band that plays at Basketball games and recently at the Hockey Games.</p>
               <br>
               <p style="line-height: 1.8;">Aside from playing music I enjoy listening to all sorts of types of music from rap, rock, pop, rnb, and dubstep.
               To be honest the only type of music I don't listen to is country (sorry to everyone who loves country I just
               don't enjoy it). </p>

               <p style="line-height: 1.8;">If you have seen my projects page you can tell I have done a lot of graphics work. My 
               sub tract at Umass is Graphics, Vision, and Robotics so I take classes specific towards those subjects. I would
               say there are two major appeals to these fields of study for me. For one they give me a chance to diversify my study
               so that I can learn about multiple disciplines. In addition, when I write a program for Graphics or Robotics I
               actually see the results. What I mean by this is that instead of just seeing some lines of text appear I see an 
               image I made appear or I see a robot move and do something spectacular because I programmed it to. An image like the
               one below is a lot cooler than some simple text on a screen</p>
