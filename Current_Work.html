               <p style="line-height: 1.8;"> Lately I have been working with this site you are looking on for multiple reasons. First off it has been a great
               way to learn twitter bootstrap and explore all of the features it provides. I have gained much frontend experience
               in terms of web development thanks to this project. This site isn't solely to show off myself but to also share my
               knowledge of programming. There are plenty of tutorials for learning how to code but none that are quite as reachable
               or comprehensive as I plan on making this wbe site. I hope that people will eventually look to my site for learning
               about all sorts of new programming concepts that they may not have heard before. In addition to programming I hope
               to eventually add a section to share my level of math knowledge. I took a course on Abstract Algebra and it was
               one of the hardest math courses I have ever taken. Unfortuantely, the only reference I had was my book since there
               were very few resources online. I hope to make a very in depth guide on the topic and make the subject more 
               approachable. </p>

              <h2><b>Molecular Playground Expansion</b></h2>
               <p style="line-height: 1.8;">Recently I completed a class project called Molecular Playground Expansion which can be found 
               <a href="https://github.com/Steve-Jones/Molecular-Playground">here</a>. You can visit the site www.teamdropout.com
               to see the prototype of this project. This was project for my software engineering class that was aimed to teach
               us about how to create software design documents for a large code base. At Umass there is a projector that displays
               3D molecules that anyone can walk up to and rotate using a kinetic. This was called Molecular Playground and
               there are installations like the one at Umass across the globe. I worked with a team of ten to design and implement
               Molecular Playground Expansion which would be a web version of the old system that would centralize and update all
               installations through this one web app. I personally worked on the database code for this website using postgresql
               and nodejs to store all of the data in our system. This is our logo:</p>
