                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">So you heard about programming and you want to learn a programming language. You heard java is pretty good
                    so you decide to go with it. But now what do you do? Well you have come to the right place. If you follow these
                    tutorials I will help guide you through the complex world of coding starting with how to download java to
                    some of the more advanced topics asscoiated with this language.</p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        The first thing you may be asking yourself is what a programming language is. Well Every computer consists of two
                        parts the hardware and software. The hardware is everything sitting in front of you. The software is the reason
                        why your computer lights up. There are tons of programming languages out there and they all have different 
                        syntax or ways of writing down the code. The newer languages like Java and C++ share many similar traits so
                        once you learn many of the topics in this section, you'll be able to learn most other languages very quickly.
                        The main challenge is simply learning the new syntax.

                       The rest of the getting started section is just getting java set up on your machine, learning about the IDE eclipse,
                       and writing your first program. If you are already past all of this feel free to move to the next section.
