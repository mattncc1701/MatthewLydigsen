                    <h2><b>What is Object Oriented Programming</b></h2>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;"> I used this term earlier and with most modern programming languages, especially java,
                    it is the basis of these languages. So what exactly is it? Well if I told you I wanted some kind of program to
                    model a video game how would you do it. Well you would need a bunch of objects like characters, environments,
                    wweapons, ect... Then with each object you want to give it attributes such as the color, the size ect... And each
                    of these objects should have things they can do such as move, change and attribute ect... This is essentially
                    how Object Oriented Programming works. You divide your code up based off of all of the objects your code needs.
                    Then you give each object a set of attributes and capabilities. Then you just create any number of those objects
                    to use in your code and you have yourself a code base.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                      Object Oriented Programming is extremely effective mainly because it is so versatile. You can model any situation
                      you could come across when programming with this setup. It allows you to literally program anything you can think
                      of. You could make something as simple as a tic tac toe player or something as complex as a robotic system. Object
                      Oreinted Programming has limitless capabilites and you should get more familiar with it because it is used all
                      of the time and will only become more popular.
