                    <h2><b>Answer</b></h2>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">Well there is no exact answer. Every language you will learn is different and has
                    strengths and weaknesses. Javascript is great for programming websites, C++ is used for a lot of graphics based
                    coding. So what are java's strengths. Well Java, unlike most languages, catches a lot of errors before you run your
                    code so you can get use to java's syntax more quickly and catch errors more easily. Java is also relatively easy
                    to learn and uses Object Oriented Programming (which will be discussed in greater detail in a later section). 
                    Java is also transferable between almost any computer so whether you are working on a pc or a mac you will be able
                    to run the same program. These reasons make java a great language to learn first. </p>

                    <h2><b>Personal Experience</b></h2>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;"> I myself have been working with java for about 7 years now so most of my experience
                    is with java. I have experience with other languages but java is by far my most skilled language so I will
                    be a ble to show you the ins and outs of this language in great detail.
