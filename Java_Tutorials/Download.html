                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;"> The first thing to do is to actually download java for your machine. To do this
                    click on the image below and simply run the exe file when is downloaded. Follow the instructions and then
                    you will have java on your machine. </p>

                    <h2><b>How to use Java</b></h2>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;"> Now that you have java the question becomes how do you actually write code and
                    use java. Well you can use command line which I will have a section on in the advanced topics section. But I
                    imagine many of the people reading this aren't familiar with command line so we will download an Integrated
                    Development Environment (IDE). Two popular java IDE's are Netbeans and Eclipse, you can also use Dr. Java but
                    I personally like Eclipse and it has a lot of nice features which I will go through in later sections. 
                    </p>

                    <h2><b>What is an IDE</b></h2>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                      In the last section I mentioned the term IDE so I thought I give a brief explanation of what that is since no one
                      told me. So an IDE is a really nice platform that allows us software developers to develop code more easily.
                      IDE's like Eclipse come with a lot of features such a compiler, interpreter, debugger, and one of the nicest
                      features in my opinion is intelligent code compeletion, which is just a fancy way of saying the program will
                      give you a list of possible things you can type in so if you forgot how to type something or the correct syntax
                      it will auto complete it. IDE's make life a lot easier for programmers which is why we are going to download
                      one so that you can focus more on learning how to program instead of having to learn a bunch of command line
                      codes that will make life a lot more difficult. Like I said Eclipse is my personal favorite environment so
                      I will show you how to download and set up Eclipse.

                    <h2><b>Download Eclipse</b></h2>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;"> First you want to go to this site <a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/" 
                    target="_blank">here</a>. Follow the instructions to download eclipse on whatever machine you are using. When 
                    eclipse is all set up opeen it up and now we must choose the working directory.
