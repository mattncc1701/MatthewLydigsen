              <p>I'm currently a student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am studying Computer Science and 
                 Computational Mathematics. Outside of class I'm a member of the University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band and I play the trumpet. I have been playing
                 the trumpet for about a decade and I am trying to learn how to play the guitar. I'm also part of the bands
                 Administrative staff, I help manage the bands website which you can check out <a href="http://www.umass.edu/band/">

              <h2><b>FIRST Robotics</b></h2>
               <p>This video above is of my FRC team back in 2013 at the Boston State Regional Finals. Our team
                one the regional that year as well as the Chairman's award. Since sophomore year of high school i have been
                heavily involved in FIRST. FIRST allows high school students working along with adult mentors to build 120 
                 pound robots to accomplish challenges FIRST presents every year. The challenge in the video above is
                shooting frisbees into goals and climbing the pyramids seen in the video. FIRST provides very challenging technical
                challenges every year and it is because of FIRST that I got my extensive background in programming, embedded 
                 systems, sensors, electronics, and overall love for engineering. If you want to learn more about FIRST
                  visit their website <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">here</a></p>
